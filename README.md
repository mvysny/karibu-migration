A collection of extension functions mimicking Vaadin 8 API but redirecting to Vaadin 14+ API where applicable.
This simplifies the process when rewriting Vaadin 8 components/layouts/view to Vaadin 14, since
you can continue using the same Vaadin 8 functions and get useful information and warnings.
For example,
there is `setWidthUndefined()` function marked as deprecated (since it's no longer in Vaadin 14), redirecting to a `setWidth(null)` call.

The jar is in Maven Central (TODO release), so it's easy to add this library to your project.

Gradle:
```groovy
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
  api("com.github.mvysny.karibu-migration:karibu-migration:x.y")
}
```

See the tag above for the latest version.

# Migration Documentation

The official Vaadin documentation on migration:

* [Upgrading from Vaadin 8](https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/guide/upgrading/v8) lists general strategies
* [Replacement components](https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/guide/upgrading/v8/5-components) - a list
   of all Vaadin 8 components and their replacement counterparts in Vaadin 14.

Usually, the upgrade is done one of the following ways:

* Employing the [Multiplatform Runtime](https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/tools/mpr/overview) which allows
   you to embed Vaadin 8 components into Vaadin 14 components (but not vice versa). The strategy
   is as follows:
  * Convert your app shell (the main route layout) to Vaadin 14, while nesting all Vaadin 8 views in Vaadin 14
    wrapper components.
  * Convert your views one-by-one to Vaadin 14.
  * For Vaadin8+14 MPR demo project see [Vaadin 14 MPR + Vaadin 8 Gradle Demo Project](https://gitlab.com/mvysny/vaadin14-mpr-gradle-demo)
* Adding a secondary Vaadin 14 servlet on classpath, then running Vaadin 8 app alongside
   the new Vaadin 14 app.

In all cases, the application needs to be converted manually, view-by-view, to Vaadin 14.

# Component-related replacements

## Component and generic

* `HasSize.setWidthUndefined()` is replaced by `setWidth(null)`
* `HasSize.setHeightUndefined()` is replaced by `setHeight(null)`
* `Component.setCaption()` is replaced by `Component.setLabel()` from karibu-tools.
   * Warning: in order for the caption to be visible, the component must be nested in `VerticalLayout`/`HorizontalLayout`/`FlexLayout`.
   * Alternatively, wrap the component in the `LabelWrapper` component decorator from karibu-tools which adds label to any component.
   * See more at [Vaadin 8->14 Counterparts blogpost](https://mvysny.github.io/vaadin-8-14-api-counterparts/)
* `Component.getCaption()` is replaced by `Component.getLabel()` from karibu-tools. 
* `CssLayout` is replaced by a `Div`
* `Component.setDescription()` is replaced by `Component.setTooltip()` from karibu-tools, which
    sets the `tooltip` DOM attribute.
* `Component.getDescription()` is replaced by `Component.getTooltip()` from karibu-tools, which
    reads the `tooltip` DOM attribute.
* Styles:
  * `setStyleName()` replaced by `setClassName`; `addStyleName()` replaced by `addClassName()`;
     `removeStyleName()` replaced by `removeClassName()`
  * `addStyleName(ValoTheme.*)` is generally replaced by `addThemeVariants(XYZVariant.LUMO_*)`
* Children:
  * `removeAllComponents()` - replace by `removeAll()`
  * `addComponent()` - replace by `add()`
  * `removeComponent()` - replace by `remove()`

## UI

It is discouraged to have a custom UI class. If this is necessary, it's better to
create a separate utility class and store it into the UI instance via `ComponentUtil.setData(UI.getCurrent(), Util.class, util)`.
Alternatively see [How to correctly extend a UI](https://vaadin.com/forum/thread/18184719/how-to-correctly-extend-a-ui).

* `UI.getUiRootPath()` - prints the context root with the leading slash, e.g. `/Gradle___karibu_helloworld_application_war` and so itâ€™s perfect for creating navigational links. Replaced with `VaadinRequest.getCurrent().getContextPath()`.

## ComboBox

* `setItemCaptionGenerator()` is replaced by `setItemLabelGenerator()`
* use `addThemeVariants(ComboBoxVariant.Small)` instead of `ValoTheme.COMBOBOX_SMALL`.
* Use `addThemeVariants(ComboBoxVariant.AlignRight)` from karibu-tools instead of `ValoTheme.COMBOBOX_ALIGN_RIGHT`
* Use `addThemeVariants(ComboBoxVariant.AlignCenter)` from karibu-tools instead of `ValoTheme.COMBOBOX_ALIGN_CENTER`
* There are no direct replacements for `ValoTheme.COMBOBOX_TINY`, `ValoTheme.COMBOBOX_LARGE`, `ValoTheme.COMBOBOX_HUGE`
  and `ValoTheme.COMBOBOX_BORDERLESS`.
* `setEmptySelectionAllowed()` -  When `allowed` was set to true, the Vaadin 8 ComboBox used to show an additional item
   representing the `null` value. This is hard to emulate via DataProvider; the
   easiest replacement is to simply show or hide the clear button. Also see [Adding support for null values to Vaadin ComboBox](https://mvysny.github.io/vaadin-combobox-null-value/)
   for more details.
* Given that, replace `setEmptySelectionCaption()` with `setPlaceholder()`.
* `setTextInputAllowed()` - no replacement. ComboBox always allows text input. Use `Select` instead
   if you want to disable text input.

## NativeSelect -> Select

* `setItemCaptionGenerator()` is replaced by `setItemLabelGenerator()`

## CheckBoxGroup

* `setItemCaptionGenerator()` is replaced by `setItemLabelGenerator()`

## RadioButtonGroup

* `setItemCaptionGenerator()` is replaced by `setItemLabelGenerator()` from karibu-tools
* No replacement for `OPTIONGROUP_SMALL` and `OPTIONGROUP_LARGE`
* RadioButtonGroup is horizontal by default; use `addThemeVariants(RadioGroupVariant.LUMO_VERTICAL)`
  to lay out buttons horizontally in absence of `ValoTheme.OPTIONGROUP_HORIZONTAL`.

There is the `RadioButtonGroupCompat` class which introduces a better Vaadin 8 compatibility:

* `setItemDescriptionGenerator()`
* `setHtmlContentAllowed()`
* It is vertical by default; also adds `setVertical(boolean)` utility setter.

## Grid

Grid:

* `isSelectionAllowed()` - replace with `isSelectionAllowed` from karibu-tools. Essentially
   check if the selection model is either `SelectionModel.Multi` or `SelectionModel.Single`.
* `Grid.addFooterRowAt(index)` - no replacement; the extension function calls either `prependFooterRow()` or `appendFooterRow()`.
* `Grid.getFooterRowCount()` - replace with `getFooterRows().size()`.
* `Grid.getHeaderRowCount()` - replace with `getHeaderRows().size()`.
* `Grid.setExpandRatio()` - replace with `setFlexGrow()`.

Grid.Column:

* `Column.setDescriptionGenerator()` - no replacement. See [issue #2315](https://github.com/vaadin/flow-components/issues/2315)
* `Column.setExpandRatio()` - replace with `setFlexGrow()`
* `Column.setCaption()` - replace with `setHeader()`
* *NOTE*: Grid.Column now expands by default; if you want to set it to a fixed width
   then you have to call `setWidth("50px").setFlexGrow(0)`.

## FlexComponent/HorizontalLayout/VerticalLayout

The way how HorizontalLayout and VerticalLayout works has been changed completely. There is no
slot mechanism anymore, and the layouting is now based on CSS Flexbox rather than on
a Vaadin-specific JavaScript code. You need to relearn how CSS Flexbox works, then
rework your layouts to work on top of CSS Flexbox. Docs to read:

* [Vaadin docs: Layouts in Platform](https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/guide/upgrading/v8/5-components/#layouts-in-platform)
* [Vaadin 10 server-side layouting for Vaadin 8 and Android developers](https://mvysny.github.io/Vaadin-10-server-side-layouting-for-Vaadin-8-and-Android-developers/)

API replacements:

* `setExpandRatio()`: replace with either `expand()` (if the expand ratio is 1) or `setFlexGrow()`
* `addComponentsAndExpand()`: replace with `addAndExpand()`

## Label

`Label` is no longer a `Div` but an actual `<label>` element. Usually the best approach is
to replace label by `Div` or `Span`.

* `new Label("", ContentMode.HTML)` is replaced by `new HtmlSpan()` from karibu-tools

# Resources

* `ClassResource` - replace with [StreamResource](https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/advanced/tutorial-dynamic-content/#using-streamresource)
* `ThemeResource` - You have two options:
  * you can store the image into the theme folder; then you can refer to the image from a CSS file as per
    [Creating a custom theme/Other Assets](https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/styling/custom-theme/#other-theme-assets).
    You can also refer to the image via `new Image("themes/my-theme/img/foo.png", "foo")`
    if you store the image to `/frontend/themes/my-theme/img/foo.png` - Vaadin will copy the static resources
    to your WAR archive, to the `/META-INF/VAADIN/webapp/VAADIN/static/themes/my-theme/img/foo.png` folder
    and will serve the images from there.
  * Alternatively you can place the images
    into the static resource folder (usually `src/main/webapp`; the image would then go to `src/main/webapp/img/foo.png`)
    then refer to the image via `new Image("img/foo.png")`.
    See the [Resource cheat sheet](https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/importing-dependencies/tutorial-ways-of-importing#resource-cheat-sheet)
    for more info.
  * Make sure to refer to the images as `new Image("img/foo.png")` and not `new Image("/img/foo.png")`
    nor `new Image("./img/foo.png")` - the first one would not work with a non-empty context root
    while the latter one will stop working for nested routes such as `@Route("my/nested/route")`.

# Further ideas

* Add extension functions for Groovy
* Add extension functions for Lombok
