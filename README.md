A collection of extension functions mimicking Vaadin 8 API but redirecting to Vaadin 14+ API where applicable. For example,
there is `setWidthUndefined()` function marked as deprecated (since it's no longer in Vaadin 14), redirecting to a `setWidth(null)` call.

The jar is in Maven Central (TODO release), so it's easy to add this library to your project.

Gradle:
```groovy
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
  api("com.github.mvysny.karibu-migration:karibu-migration:x.y")
}
```

See the tag above for the latest version.

* `HasSize.setWidthUndefined()` is replaced by `setWidth(null)`
* `HasSize.setHeightUndefined()` is replaced by `setHeight(null)`
* `new Label("", ContentMode.HTML)` is replaced by `new HtmlSpan()` from karibu-tools
